Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
ans ) 
 Python is called general purpose because it can used to design and develop a wide variety of applications, across multiple domain. High-level programming language means it's more user-friendly


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
ans)
    Dynamically typed language means that variables are checked against types only when the program is executing. We don't need to declare the variable type, the interpreter automatically interprets it.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Pros:

Easy to use
Easy to integrate
Multi-paradigm approach
High library support

-Language Development
-Prototyping
-Software Development
-Data Science and Machine Learning
-Scripting

 A variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object. Once an object is assigned to a variable, you can refer to the object by that name.

var = 17

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
ans)
 By using input() function.



Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
ans  it will taek as string

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans. Type casting means changing the datatype of the variable. We can only type casting the datatype having higher bit value to the lower bit value.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Yes.

x, y, z = input("Enter three values: ").split(",")
print("Total number of students: ", x)
print("Number of boys is : ", y)
print("Number of girls is : ", z)
print()

x = [int(x) for x in input("Enter multiple value: ").split(",")]
print("Number of list is: ", x) 

Q10. What are keywords?
ans)
 Keywords in Python are reserved words that can not be used as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier.

Ans. Yes we can but we shoudn't as it will override the properties of the keyword.
Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans12. Indentation is the whitespace used in Python. Indentation is used to create block of statement.
Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
ans) Using print() function.

Q14. What are operators in Python?
ans)
Ans14. Symbols or keywords used to perform certain operations on values or variable are known as operators. There are different types of operators like

-Arithmetic operators
-Comparison Operators
-Logical Operators
-Bitwise Operators
-Assignment Operators

True and False and True -> False
1 or 0 or 0 -> 1
Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

ans) In large projects we have to control the flow of execution of our program and we want to execute some set of statements only if the given condition is satisfied, and a different set of statements when itâ€™s not satisfied.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
ans) if is the first condition check for the condition.
if "if" is False then elif's condition is checked.

else is checked when all the upper condition fails.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

ans)  age = int(input("Enter you age: "))

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
Ans40. Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list. The sequence of values stored in a tuple can be of any type, and they are indexed by integers. Tuples are immutable where as list are mutable. We can also faster through the tuples than the list.

tup = tuple(tup)
tup

Ans46. We can create set using curly brackets {}. Keep in mind empty {} will result in dictionary hence there must be some value in the brackets.

Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.
Ans47.

set1 = {"iNeuron"}
set1

Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.
Ans48.

set1.add("Big")
set1.add("Data")
set1

Q49. How is update() different from add()?
Ans49. We can add more than one element in a single go using update(), but using add() it's not possible.

Q50. What is clear() in sets?
Ans50. To remove all the elements from the set, clear() function is used.

Q51. What is frozen set?
Ans51. Frozen sets in Python are immutable objects that only support methods and operators that produce a result without affecting the frozen set or sets to which they are applied. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation.

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?
Ans52.

--Frozen sets are immutable where as sets are mutable.
--Sets can't be used as keys in dictionary where as frozen sets can be used.

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.
Ans53. Python set Union() Method returns a new set which contains all the items from the original set.

set1 = {2, 4, 5, 6}
set2 = {4, 6, 7, 8}
set3 = {7, 8, 9, 10}

print("set1 U set2 : ", set1 | set2)

print("set1 U set2 U set3 :", set1 |set2 | set3)

Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.
Ans54. Python set intersection() method returns a new set with an element that is common to all set

set1 = {2, 4, 5, 6}
set2 = {4, 6, 7, 8}
set3 = {4, 6, 8}

print("set1 intersection set2 : ", set1.intersection(set2))

print("set1 intersection set2 intersection set3 :", set1.intersection(set2, set3))

Q55. What is dictionary ibn Python?
Ans55. Dictionary in Python is a collection of keys values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other data types which hold only a single value as an element.

Q56. How is dictionary different from all other data structures.
Ans56. Dictionary is having key and value pair where as all other data structures have only values in them.

Q57. How can we delare a dictionary in Python?

Q58. What will the output of the following?
var = {}
print(type(var))

Ans59.

Dict = {}
Dict[0] = "Hello"
Dict[1] = "Course: ["Data Science", "Big Data"]"

Q60. Create a dictionary and access all the values in that dictionary.
Ans60.

Dict = {"Name": "Vishal", "Experience": 3, "Organisation":"iNeuron"}
for i, j in Dict.items():
  print(f"Key is {i} and value is {j}")

Q61. Create a nested dictionary and access all the element in the inner dictionary.
Ans61.

Dict = {"Name": {"f_name":"Vishal", "l_name":"Singh"}, "Experience": 3, "Organisation":"iNeuron"}
for i, j in Dict["Name"].items():
  print(f"Key is {i} and value is {j}")

Q62. What is the use of get() function?
Ans62. get() is also to access the elements in dictionary.
Dict = {"Name": "Venkata", "Experience": 0, "Organisation":"iNeuron"}
print(Dict.get("Name"))

Q63. What is the use of items() function?
Ans63. items() method is used to return the list with all dictionary keys with values.

Q64. What is the use of pop() function?
ans ) it deletes the last value in list or dict 

Q65. What is the use of popitems() function?
Ans65. popitem() method removes the last inserted key-value pair from the dictionary and returns it as a tuple.

Q66. What is the use of keys() function?
Ans66. keys() method returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys in the dictionary.

Q67. What is the use of values() function?
Ans67. values() is an inbuilt method in Python programming language that returns a view object. The view object contains the values of the dictionary, as a list.

Q68. What are loops in Python?
Ans68. Loops are used the iterate over a block of statement multiple times

Q69. How many type of loop are there in Python?
ans) for and while loops 

Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?
Ans70. When we know the exact number of iterations, we can use for loop. When we want the to run till a certain condition is true we can use while loop.

Q71. What is the use of continue statement?
Ans71. Continue Statement skips the execution of the program block from after the continue statement and forces the control to start the next iteration.

Q72. What is the use of break statement?
Ans72. break statement in Python is used to bring the control out of the loop when some external condition is triggered. break statement is put inside the loop body

Q73. What is the use of pass statement?
Ans73. The pass statement is a null statement. But the difference between pass and comment is that comment is ignored by the interpreter whereas pass is not ignored.

Q74. What is the use of range() function?
Ans74. range() function returns a sequence of numbers, in a given range. The most common use of it is to iterate sequence on a sequence of numbers

Q75. How can you loop over a dictionary?
Ans75.

statesAndCapitals = {
	'Gujarat': 'Gandhinagar',
	'Maharashtra': 'Mumbai',
	'Rajasthan': 'Jaipur',
	'Bihar': 'Patna'
}

for state in statesAndCapitals:
	print(state)
